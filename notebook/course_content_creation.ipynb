In the accompanying interactive tutorials, students have the opportunity to review the material taught in the seminar and further train their capacity to explain these concepts and theories.\\n\\nThis module aims at transmitting fundamental knowledge of development and related issues from an economics perspective. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and economic dynamics of development constitutes an important basis for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and helps students make sense of economic behaviors in many situations, including professional settings.

As John Berger has suggested this could be because we can see and recognize the world around us before we learn how to speak. Images have been with us since the earliest days of human history. In fact, the earliest records of human history are images found on cave walls across the world. We use images to capture abstract ideas, to catalogue and organize the world, to represent the world, to capture specific moments, to trace time and change, to tell stories, to express feelings, to better understand, to provide evidence and more. At the same time, images exert their power on us, seducing us into believing in their âinnocenceâ, that is into forgetting that as representations they are also interpretations, i.e., a particular version of the world.\\n\\nThe purpose of this course is to explore multiple ways in which images and the visual in general mediate and structure human experiences and practices from more specialized discourses, e.g., scientific discourses, to more informal and personal day-to-day practices, such as self-fashioning in cyberspace. We will look at how social and historical contexts affect how we see, as well as what is visible and what is not. We will explore the centrality of the visual to the intellectual activity, from early genres of scientific drawing to visualizations of big data. We will examine whether one can speak of visual culture of protest, look at the relationship between looking and subjectivity and, most importantly, ponder the relationship between the visual and the real.\\n# Intended Learning Outcomes'),\n",

While much of human communication involves language, there is a complex multichannel system of nonverbal communication that enriches linguistic content, provides context, and is also involved in structuring dynamic interaction. Interactants achieve goals by encoding information that is interpreted in the light of current context in transactions with others. This complexity implies also that there are frequent misunderstandings as a senderâs intention is not fulfilled.\\n\\nStudents in this course will learn to understand the structure of communication processes in a variety of formal and informal contexts. They will learn what constitutes challenges to achieving successful communication and how to communicate effectively, taking the context and specific requirements for a target audience into consideration.

The law often recognizes ways in which groups and organizations can have rights, but is there a way in which we can understand how groups have responsibility for outcomes that they should be accountable for. We need to figure out then whether there is a notion of group agency that does not simply boil down to the sum of individual actions. We will explore the ways in which individual actions lead to collective agency.\\n\\nFinally, we will explore the ways in which occupying a leadership role can make one accountable for the actions of others over which one has authority.\\n\\n### Intended Learning Outcomes\\n\\nStudents acquire transferable and key skills in this module. By the end of this module, the students will be able to:\\n1. understand and reflect how the social and moral world views that rely on agency and responsibility are compatible, if they are, with current scientific world views.\\n2. understand how science is an economic sector, populated by large powerful organizations that set norms and fund research agendas.\\n3. identify the difference between being a leader of others or of a group â whether a research group or a lab or a company â and being in charge of the group.\\n4. learn to be a leader of others and groups.

These include: Decomposition (breaking the larger problem down into smaller ones); Pattern recognition (identifying structural similarities); Abstraction (ignoring irrelevant particulars of the problem); and Creating Algorithms (problem-solving formulas). But even more basic to what you are doing is the process of drawing inferences from the material you have. After all, how else are you going to create a problem-solving formula, if you draw incorrect inferences about what information has.\\n## Logic and Computational Thinking\\n\\nWhat you must do is apply the rules of logic to the information to draw inferences that are warranted. We distinguish between informal and formal systems of logic, both of which are designed to indicate fallacies as well as warranted inferences. If I argue for a conclusion by appealing to my physical ability to coerce you, I prove nothing about the truth of what I claim. If anything, by doing so I display my lack of confidence in my argument. Or if the best I can do is berate you for your skepticism, I have done little more than offer an ad hominem instead of an argument. Our focus will be on formal systems of logic, since they are at the heart of both scientific argumentation and computer developed algorithms.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 1}, page_content='There are in fact many different kinds of logic and all figure to varying degrees in scientific inquiry. There are inductive types of logic, which purport to formalize the relationship between premises that if true offer evidence on behalf of a conclusion and the conclusion and are represented as claims about the extent to which the conclusion is confirmed by the premises. There are deductive types of logic, which introduce a different relationship between premise and conclusion. These variations of logic consist in rules that if followed entail that if the premises are true then the conclusion too must be true.\\n\\nThere are also modal types of logic which are applied specifically to the concepts of necessity and possibility, and thus to the relationship among sentences that include either or both those terms. And there is also what are called deontic logic, a modification of logic that purport to show that there are rules of inference that allow us to infer what we ought to do from facts about the circumstances in which we find ourselves. In the natural and social sciences most of the emphasis has been placed on inductive logic, whereas in math it is placed on deductive logic, and in modern physics there is an increasing interest in the concepts of possibility and necessity and thus in modal logic. The humanities, especially normative discussions in philosophy and literature are the province of deontic logic.\\n\\nThis module will also take students through the central aspects of computational thinking, as it is related to logic; it will introduce the central concepts in each, their relationship to one another and begin to provide the conceptual apparatus and practical skills for scientific inquiry and research.\\n\\n### Intended Learning Outcomes'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 1}, page_content='Reasoning can be informal and sometimes even appear unstructured. When we recognize some reasoning as unstructured yet appropriate what we usually have in mind is that it is not linear. Most reasoning we are familiar with is linear in character. From A we infer B, and from A and B we infer C, which all together support our commitment to D. The same form of reasoning applies whether the evidence for A, B or C is direct or circumstantial. What changes in these cases is perhaps the weight we give to the evidence and thus the confidence we have in drawing inferences from it.\\n\\nEspecially in cases where reasoning can be supported by quantitative data, wherever quantitative data can be obtained either directly or by linear or nonlinear models, the visualization of the corresponding data can become key in both, reasoning and argumentation. A graphical representation can reduce the complexity of argumentation and is considered a must in effective scientific communication. Consequently, the course will also focus on smart and compelling ways for data visualization - in ways that go beyond what is typically taught in statistics or mathematics lectures. These tools are constantly developing, as a reflection of new software and changes in state of the presentation art. Which graph or bar chart to use best for which data, the use of colors to underline messages and arguments, but also the pitfalls when presenting data in a poor or even misleading manner. This will also help in readily identifying intentional misrepresentation of data by others, the simplest to recognize being truncating the ordinate of a graph in order to exaggerate trends. This frequently leads to false arguments, which can then be readily countered.'),\n",

Sometimes we may be lucky and our bad acts don't have harmful effects on others. Other times we may be unlucky and reasonable decisions can lead to unexpected or unforeseen adverse consequences for others. We are therefore held accountable both for choices and for outcomes. In either case, accountability expresses the judgment that we bear responsibility for what we do and what happens as a result. But our responsibility and our accountability in these cases is closely connected to the idea that we have agency.\\n\\nAgency presumes that we are the source of the choices we make and the actions that result from those choices. For some, this may entail the idea that we have free will. But there is a scientific world view that holds that all actions are determined by the causes that explain them, which is the idea that if we knew the causes of your decisions in advance, we would know the decision you would make even before you made it. If that is so, how can your choice be free? And if it is not free, how can you be responsible for it? And if you cannot be responsible, how can we justifiably hold you to account for it? These questions express the centuries-old questions about the relationship between free will and a determinist world view: for some, the conflict between a scientific world view and a moral world view.\\n## Text\"),\n",

In society we organize ourselves into groups: e.g. tightly organized social groups, loosely organized market economies, political societies, companies, and more. These groups have structure. Some individuals are given the responsibility of leading the group and of exercising authority. But one can exercise authority over others in a group merely by giving orders and threatening punishment for non-compliance. Exercising authority is not the same thing as being a leader? For one can lead by example or by encouraging others to exercise personal judgment and authority. What then is the essence of leadership?\\n\\nThe module has several educational goals. The first is for students to understand the difference between actions that we undertake for which we can reasonably held accountable and things that we do but which we are not responsible for. For example, a twitch is an example of the latter, but so too may be a car accident we cause as a result of a heart attack we had no way of anticipating or controlling. This suggests the importance of control to responsibility. At the heart of personal agency is the idea of control. The second goal is for students to understand what having control means. Some think that the scientific view is that the world is deterministic, and if it is then we cannot have any personal control over what happens, including what we do. Others think that the quantum scientific view entails a degree of indeterminacy and that free will and control are possible, but only in the sense of being unpredictable or random. But then random outcomes are not ones we control either. So, we will devote most attention to trying to understand the relationships between control, causation and predictability.'),\n",

The subdiscipline of macroeconomics investigates the workings of the overall economy, focusing on how shifts in aggregate demand and supply affect variables such as employment, gross domestic product, inflation, and the balance of trade. This module applies theoretical concepts from macroeconomics to contemporary policy questions, such as when, why and how governments intervene in the economy. The module will distinguish fiscal and monetary policies, and what these government interventions mean for various markets and economic actors. The lectures cover the material students need to know to take and pass the module examination. In the tutorials, the students further integrate the material taught in the lectures via discussions of related concepts, policy problems, scientific studies, and exercises.\\n\\nA command of macroeconomics constitutes the basis for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and management, further preparing students for graduate study in these fields. Beyond these academic qualifications, students will be equipped with analytical tools that help make sense of the economic conditions that affect both their private and professional lives. With its coverage of market regulation and the policy implications of macroeconomic theories, this module also enables students to understand public affairs from the perspective of whole economies. Textbook-based lectures ensure the transmission of the necessary knowledge. The accompanying, interactive tutorials further promote the studentsâ capacity to differentiate and explain the concepts taught in class.\\n# Intended Learning Outcomes\\n\\nBy the end of this module, students will be able to:'),\n",

This work incorporates many 20th century developments, including statistical methods â but with a reemphasis on finding the why, or the cause, behind statistical correlations â, progress in understanding the logic, semantics and metaphysics of conditionals and counterfactuals, developments based on insights from the likes of philosopher Hans Reichenbach or biological statistician Sewall Wright into causal precedence and path analysis, and much more. The result is a new toolkit to identify causes and build causal explanations. Yet even as we get better at identifying causes, this raises new (or old) questions about causality, including metaphysical questions about the nature of causes (and effects, events, objects, etc), but also questions about what we really use causality for (understanding the world as it is or just to glean predictive control of specific outcomes), about how causality is used differently in different fields.\\n## Course Overview\\n\\nThis course will introduce students to the mathematical formalism derived from Pearlâs work, based on directed acyclic graphs and probability theory. Building upon previous work by Reichenbach and Wright, Pearl defines a \"a calculus of interventions\" of \"do-calculus\" for talking about interventions and their relation to causation and counterfactuals. This model has been applied in various areas ranging from econometrics to statistics, where acquiring knowledge about causality is of great importance.'),\n",

Where do you begin? Arguably, the first and most difficult task you face is to figure out what the heart of the problem actually is. In doing that you will look for structural similarities between the problem posed and other problems that arise in different fields that others may have addressed successfully. Those similarities may point you to a pathway for resolving the problem you have been asked to solve. But it is not enough to look for structural similarities. Sometimes relying on similarities may even be misleading. Once youâve settled tentatively on what you take to be the heart of the matter, you will naturally look for materials, whether evidence or arguments, that you believe is relevant to its potential solution. But the evidence you investigate of course depends on your formulation of the problem, and your formulation of the problem likely depends on the tools you have available â including potential sources of evidence and argumentation. You cannot ignore this interactivity, but you canât allow yourself to be hamstrung entirely by it. But there is more. The problem itself may be too big to be manageable all at once, so you will have to explore whether it can be broken into manageable parts and if the information you have bears on all or only some of those parts. And later you will face the problem of whether the solutions to the particular sub problems can be put together coherently to solve the entire problem taken as a whole.')]"

The concept of living and learning together on an international campus with many cultural and social activities supplements studentsâ education. In addition, Constructor University offers professional advising and counseling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constructor Universityâs educational concept is highly regarded both nationally and internationally. While the university has consistently achieved top marks over the last decade in Germanyâs most comprehensive and detailed university ranking by the Center for Higher Education (CHE), it has also been listed by one of the most widely observed university rankings, the Times Higher Education (THE) ranking.

      "### 1.1.2 Program Concept\n",
      "The Global Economics and Management (GEM) study program is among Constructor Universityâs longest standing programs. In line with the universityâs chief mission, the GEM program delivers high-quality research and teaching to train students from all over the world in the economic analysis and managerial skills they need to understand and address complex global problems affecting markets, organizations, and society. Students explore questions of utmost importance to contemporary economies and public affairs, such as: How do economic agents contribute to and how are they impacted by global economic dynamics such as trade, growth, and inequality? How do governments\n",
      "## Responding to Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of the GEM study program is to enable graduates to take an active role in shaping future economic and social processes. This program therefore combines the disciplines of Economics and Management Studies. Economics studies examine how individuals, households, firms, and governments make decisions regarding the production, distribution, acquisition, and allocation of scarce resources. The Management discipline studies the design and administration of firms, nonprofits, and public organizations, as well as the consequences of managerial actions and decisions on individuals, society, and economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students discover the mechanisms connecting globalized economic dynamics, business interests, and managerial action to prepare them for future responsibilities in an increasingly interconnected world, shedding light on issues such as inequalities, economic development, global trade, and climate change. This scientific education offers a solid foundation in quantitative techniques and introduces students to qualitative research methods as well. Their work in seminars is designed to develop skills in professional communication, writing, and problem-solving and to help students develop their academic and professional profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our learning and teaching methods rely on a mix of lectures, seminars, and tutorials. The lectures and seminars provide introductions to fundamental knowledge in general fields of economics and management. We encourage interactivity during these sessions through a variety of inputs, including group discussions of academic papers, case studies using the Harvard case method, exercises, role-playing, and workshop-like sessions on writing and presenting skills. Accompanying tutorials help the students to prepare and review the material and to prepare for the examinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.2 Program-specific Educational Aims\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1.3 Specific Advantages of the Global Economics and Management Program at Constructor University\n",
      "\n",
      "Constructor University students can choose to specialize in GEM or to combine their GEM studies with a minor from another discipline at Constructor University, such as International Relations: Politics and History, Integrated Social Sciences, Psychology, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Industrial Engineering and Management, or Computer Science. Upon completing the program, typical GEM graduates have acquired knowledge in their academic fields of choice, and developed scientific rigor and ethics, reflexivity, and the capacity to integrate multiple disciplines, points of view, and opinions into their decisions. These qualities qualify them for graduate studies in the fields of economics, development studies, management, and business administration, as well as for positions as consultants, analysts, and roles in business development more generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economics and management are two disciplines that complement each other. In most professions, both perspectives are needed. Managers need to understand the greater economic environment in which they operate; and national and international governmental institutions need to understand how private organizations and businesses are run. As Constructor Universityâs campus includes students from more than 100 countries, GEM graduates are in the best environment to discuss and understand why the prior conditions and outcomes of economic and managerial decisions can be so different in different parts of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first-year courses include introductory modules on economics, international business, and quantitative skills and methods. In the second year, the curriculum explores global policy questions.\n",
      "such as economic development, environmental challenges, the globalization of economic agents and institutions, and the management of increasingly diversified organizations. In the third year, students delve deeper into selected, contemporary topics and techniques of utmost importance for their career and future studies, including modules on information economics, advanced econometrics, and public and non-profit management, as well as modules from other programs. Our students thus come to appreciate that political, social, cultural, and technological framework conditions have a decisive influence on economic outcomes on all continents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1.3.1 Qualification Aims\n",
      "The GEM study program awards a Bachelor of Arts degree. This program is interdisciplinary and does not compare to a classical economics degree. The GEM study program seeks to explain how economies and economic agents operate and coordinate their interactions, both economically and managerially. The program is oriented more toward economic and management theories and policy discussions than towards mathematics. The scientific education provided by the program includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches, with a focus on quantitative techniques (e.g. statistics, R, and econometrics).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1.3.2 Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
      "By the end of the program, students will be able to:\n",
      "1. distinguish among the interests and activities of private business organizations, governments, international organizations, civil society associations and non-profit organizations;\n",
      "2. evaluate economic, political, and societal problems using economics and management theories and scientific reasoning-specifically: statistical, mathematical, case-study based, econometrical, and qualitative reasoning;\n",
      "3. apply economic theories and analyses to issues of wide public and professional concern;\n",
      "4. apply business and management theories to basic dimensions of the conduct of business across sectors;\n",
      "5. articulate the relationships between business decisions, economic policies, and national and international public affairs;\n",
      "6. identify the appropriate approach to deal with business and institutional actors depending on their interests;\n",
      "7. identify the differences among national and regional perceptions of and approaches to economic reasoning;\n",
      "8. apply the social and intercultural competencies needed to take on responsibility in diverse, international teams with competing and overlapping interests;\n",
      "9. outline and discuss their arguments and those of others using a combination of economic, organizational and institutional analyses;\n",
      "10. assess and interpret relevant information for policy analyses in selected micro- and macroeconomic topics;\n",
      "11. describe the state of published knowledge in economics and management;\n",
      "12. explain real-world situations and problems of organizations and industries combining key contemporary theories of economics and management with methods and insights of other disciplines;\n",
      "13. communicate economic and managerial analysis and solutions appropriately to their audience;\n",
      "14. investigate economic and managerial problems and undertake scientific or applied research projects;\n",
      "## 1.4 Career Options and Support\n",
      "\n",
      "With its combination of economics and management, the program gives students solid labor-market qualifications for junior management positions with responsibilities in function-specific tasks and projects within areas of employment such as business development, sales and marketing, human resource management, organizational development, strategy and technology consulting, as well as for analyst positions in these fields or in specific industries. Our graduates have obtained internships and positions in a variety of institutions, including the World Bank, MIT, and the Harvard Kennedy School, and at companies such as Volkswagen, Deutsche Bank, Ernst & Young, Deutsche BÃ¶rse, KPMG, Henkel, Daimler, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Uber, Vodafone, Zalando and Deloitte, as well as in various startups. A degree in GEM will also equip students with transferable skills that will allow them to move into other areas of employment with a variety of employers such as national and multi-national companies, governmental agencies, NGOs, international organizations, think tanks, special interest groups, and research institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GEM program has taken graduates onto a rich diversity of career paths. The academic rigor of the program prepares students for highly ranked graduate programs. GEM alumni have a strong track record with leading institutions around the world, such as the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, St Gallen, Bonn, Munich (TUM) and Mannheim and graduate schools such as ESADE, Copenhagen Business School, BI Norwegian Business School, Hertie School of Governance, London Business School, and the London School of Economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to their experience of working and living with students from more than 100 countries on Constructor Universityâs international campus, GEM graduates are well prepared to take on responsibility in intercultural work environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Career Service Center (CSC) helps students in their career development. It provides students with high-quality training and coaching in CV creation, cover letter formulation, interview preparation, effective presenting, business etiquette, and employer research as well as in many other aspects, thus helping students identify and follow up on rewarding careers after graduating from Constructor University. Furthermore, the Alumni Office helps students establish a long-lasting and worldwide network which provides support when exploring job options in academia, industry, and elsewhere.\n",

This gives students the opportunity to gain first-hand practical experience in a professional environment, apply their knowledge and understanding in a professional context, reflect on the relevance of their major to employment and society, reflect on their own role in employment and society, and find a professional orientation. The internship can also establish valuable contacts for the studentsâ Bachelorâs thesis project, for the selection of a Master program graduate school, or further employment after graduation. This module is complemented by career advising and several career skills workshops throughout all six semesters that prepare students for the transition from student life to professional life. As an alternative to the full-time internship, students interested in setting up their own company can apply for a start-up option to focus on developing their business plans.

      "To prepare for this module, students are recommended to read the article âResearch on teaching economics to undergraduates,â published in the Journal of Economic Literature in 2015. The article will allow students to get a first-hand look at the challenges of teaching economics from the viewpoint of those who teach it.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Content and Educational Aims\n",
      "The study of economics is concerned with the allocation of scarce resources and the associated implications for efficiency, equity, and human welfare. This module introduces the field of microeconomics, focusing on the role of markets in facilitating exchanges between different sectors of the economy such as workers, consumers, firms, and government institutions. Topics addressed include consumer theory, the cost structures and behavior of firms in various industries, competition, monopoly, and government regulation. The module applies theoretical concepts to contemporary policy questions, such as when government intervention is justified to correct market imperfections.\n",
      "\n",
      "This module aims at transmitting fundamental knowledge of economics at the level of economic agents. A command of microeconomics constitutes the basis for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and management and helps make sense of economic behaviors in many situations, including professional settings. With its focus on questions of welfare and the policy implications of microeconomic theories, this module also enables students to understand public affairs from an economic perspective at the micro level and promotes their capacity to differentiate among and explain the concepts taught in class. Textbook-based lectures ensure the transmission of the necessary knowledge. The accompanying, interactive tutorials further promote the studentsâ capacity to describe and give examples of the concepts taught in class.\n",
      "# Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of this module, students will be able to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Explain how economic concepts such as opportunity costs and the gains from trade can be applied to a range of themes of relevance to human welfare.\n",
      "2. Use graphical depictions to derive insights into how markets function.\n",
      "3. Distinguish between equity and efficiency when evaluating the outcomes of economic policies.\n",
      "4. Explain and differentiate among fundamental microeconomic models, such as that demonstrating the gains from trade, using graphs as visual aids.\n",
      "5. Explain the policy implications of microeconomic theories.\n",

      "The study of economics is concerned with the allocation of scarce resources and the associated implications for efficiency, equity, and human welfare. The subdiscipline of macroeconomics investigates the workings of the overall economy, focusing on how shifts in aggregate demand and supply affect variables such as employment, gross domestic product, inflation, and the balance of trade. This module applies theoretical concepts from macroeconomics to contemporary policy questions, such as when, why and how governments intervene in the economy. The module will distinguish fiscal and monetary policies, and what these government interventions mean for various markets and economic actors. The lectures cover the material students need to know to take and pass the module examination. In the tutorials, the students further integrate the material taught in the lectures via discussions of related concepts, policy problems, scientific studies, and exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "A command of macroeconomics constitutes the basis for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and management, further preparing students for graduate study in these fields. Beyond these academic qualifications, students will be equipped with analytical tools that help make sense of the economic conditions that affect both their private and professional lives. With its coverage of market regulation and the policy implications of macroeconomic theories, this module also enables students to understand public affairs from the perspective of whole economies. Textbook-based lectures ensure the transmission of the necessary knowledge. The accompanying, interactive tutorials further promote the studentsâ capacity to differentiate and explain the concepts taught in class.\n",

      "\n",
      "This module covers the application of theoretical and empirical economics to the analysis of environmental and resource management issues. Specific topics include global climate change, energy use, transportation, and the extraction of exhaustible and non-exhaustible resources. Cross-cutting these topics is an emphasis on how economic analysis can contribute to contemporary policy debates, such as about the strengths and weaknesses of regulatory- and market-based policy instruments for reducing CO2 emissions. We also examine the implications for industry of national and international efforts to protect the environment. In the tutorials, students have the opportunity to review the material taught in the seminar and further train their understanding of these concepts and theories in group discussions of concepts and case study problems.\n",

      "This module aims at transmitting fundamental knowledge of environmental dynamics from an economics perspective. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and economic dimensions of environmental issues constitutes an important basis for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and the management of sustainability and helps students make sense of economic behaviors in many situations, including professional settings. With its interest in questions of resource exhaustibility and in the impact of economic behavior on the environment, this module helps students to understand public affairs from an environmental perspective and promotes their capacity to anticipate the consequences of economic and managerial decisions, including their own.\n",

      "The goal of this module is to build on the knowledge acquired in the âEconometricsâ module, covering select advanced concepts of regression analysis as it applies to empirical social science research. The prime learning objective is to understand different approaches of secondary data analysis, where and how to apply particular econometric estimators, and their limitations. Particular emphasis will be placed on identifying exogenous sources of variation and methods for identifying causal relationships between variables. The class will also cover some of the opportunities and pitfalls associated with the analysis of âbig data,â drawing on current examples and available data. Textbook-based lectures ensure the transmission of the necessary knowledge. Exercises in class further promote the studentsâ capacity to differentiate and debate the merits of alternative econometric techniques for testing particular hypotheses.\n",

      "This module aims at consolidating studentsâ command of econometrics and related statistical techniques. A command of econometrics constitutes an important fundament for undergraduate studies in the fields of economics and helps students to critically appraise scientific statements about causality in many situations, including professional settings. This module helps students to assess and criticize econometric findings in academic papers and promotes their capacity to differentiate between bias and statistical precision in interpreting their own econometric results.\n",

This module supports the programsâ aims of preparing students for gainful, qualified employment and the development of their personality.\n",
      "## Internship Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "The full-time internship must be related to the studentsâ major area of study and lasts a minimum of two consecutive months, normally scheduled just before the 5th semester, with the internship event and submission of the internship report in the 5th semester. Upon approval by the SPC and SCS, the internship may take place at other times, such as before teaching starts in the 3rd semester or after teaching finishes in the 6th semester. The Study Program Coordinator or their faculty delegate approves the intended internship a priori by reviewing the tasks in either the Internship Contract or Internship Confirmation from the respective internship institution or company. Further regulations as set out in the Policies for Bachelor Studies apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students will be gradually prepared for the internship in semesters 1 to 4 through a series of mandatory information sessions, seminars, and career events. The purpose of the Career Services Information Sessions is to provide all students with basic facts about the job market in general, and especially in Germany and the EU, and services provided by the Student Career Support. In the Career Skills Seminars, students will learn how to engage in the internship/job search, how to create a competitive application (CV, Cover Letter, etc.), and how to successfully conduct themselves at job interviews and/or assessment centers. In addition to these mandatory sections, students can customize their skill set regarding application challenges and their intended career path in elective seminars. Finally, during the Career Events organized by the Career Service Center (e.g., the annual Constructor Career Fair and single employer events on and off campus), students will have the opportunity to apply their acquired job market skills in an actual internship/job search situation and to gain their desired internship in a high-quality environment and with excellent employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an alternative to the full-time internship, students can apply for the StartUp Option. Following the same schedule as the full-time internship, the StartUp Option allows students who are particularly interested in founding their own company to focus on the development of their business plan over a period of two consecutive months. Participation in the StartUp Option depends on a successful presentation of the studentâs initial StartUp idea. This presentation will be held at the beginning of the 4th semester. A jury of faculty members will judge the studentâs potential to realize their idea and approve the participation of the students. The StartUp Option is supervised by the Faculty StartUp Coordinator. At the end of the StartUp Option, students submit their business plan. Further regulations as outlined in the Policies for Bachelor Studies apply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concluding Internship Event will be conducted within each study program (or a cluster of related study programs) and will formally conclude the module by providing students the opportunity to present on their internships and reflect on the lessons learned within their major area of study. The purpose of this event is not only to self-reflect on the whole internship process, but also to create a professional network within the academic community, especially by entering the Alumni Network after graduation. It is recommended that all three classes (years) of the same major are present at this event to enable networking between older and younger students and to create an educational environment for younger students to observe the âlessons learnedâ from the diverse internships of their elder fellow students.\n",

      "In this module, students conduct in-depth research on a specific topic related to the GEM major. The topic may either be part of the supervisorâs ongoing research or be suggested by the student her/himself, but supervisors hold the right to specify the topics ultimately. Data sources can be primary or secondary and can include online datasets, interviews, direct observations, or self-conducted surveys. Students will be evaluated on the breadth and quality of their research. The thesis must be submitted to a supervisor by the end of the examination period. The accompanying research seminar shows students how to narrow down a topic into a meaningful and manageable piece of research. Students will receive advice and learn how to structure their argumentation, their methodological approach, as well as on the presentation and visualization of their results. Moreover, students will acquire proficiency in techniques of localizing and utilizing academic output (monographs, edited volumes, journal articles, etc.) for their own research work. Ethical academic conduct and the various academic standard requirements in citation, referencing, and data documentation will be discussed in further detail.\n",

      "We live in a world full of data and more and more decisions are taken based on a comprehensive analysis of data. A central method of data analysis is the use of models describing the relationship between a set of predictor variables and a response. This module provides a thorough introduction to quantitative data analysis covering graphical representations, numerical summary statistics, correlation, and regression models. The module also introduces the fundamental concepts of statistical inference. Students learn about the different data types, how to best visualize them and how to draw conclusions from the graphical representations. Students will learn in this module the ideas and techniques of regression models within the generalized linear model framework involving multiple predictors and co-variates. Students will learn how to become an intelligent user of statistical techniques from a prosumer's perspective to assess the quality of presented statistical results and to produce high-quality analyses by themselves. By using illustrative examples from economics, engineering, and the natural and social sciences, students will gain the relevant background knowledge for their specific major as well as an interdisciplinary glimpse of other research fields. The general objective of the module is to enable students to become skilled statistical modelers who are well versed in the various assumptions, limitations, and controversies of statistical models and their application. Regular exercises and practical sessions will corroborate the studentsâ proficiency with the statistical software R.\n",

      "Qualitative researchers explore the structure of everyday life and the meaning that events, other persons, and their actions hold for us. To do so, they take an in-depth look at a few selected cases, such as organizations, campaigns, or people. We will look at the rationale and constructivist and interpretivist principles underlying qualitative research and from there move on to specific designs (such as grounded theory or ethnography), design principles (such as purposive strategies for selecting cases), and research methods. The focus of the module will be on learning about and trying out methods for collecting and analyzing qualitative data. Among methods for collecting qualitative data, relevant topics include semi-structured and narrative interviews, focus groups, observation, working with documents and with visual elements. Methods for analyzing qualitative data include, for example, coding, qualitative content analysis, discourse analysis, visual analysis, semiotics, or iconography. The module has a strong hands-on component. It is held in part as a seminar and in part as a lab where students apply the methods to data from their own fields of study. During the lab sessions, students are required to participate in and report on activities involving the application and testing of selected methods. For assessment and grading, students will carry out their own small research project, in which they bring to bear different methods to a topic of their choice.\n",

Specifically, the goal is to expose students to some of the issues and challenges typically confronted by econometricians when analyzing empirical data in the realms of social science research, business, and finance. Emphasis will be placed on the intuition underlying various commonly applied econometric techniques and on the steps needed to implement them. The module expands on the knowledge acquired in statistics and intensifies discussions of multiple regression analysis. The general objective is to become familiar with contemporary methods that are used in econometric and business analyses and to become a critical reader of case studies. In this regard, a clear distinction will be drawn along two dimensions: between questions of statistical significance versus those of economic or social significance; and between correlation and causation. The module takes a practical approach that covers how to estimate econometric models using R software. Sessions will often include computer applications to foster understanding of the discussed topics.\n",

      "Suppose a friend asks you to help solve a complicated problem? Where do you begin? Arguably, the first and most difficult task you face is to figure out what the heart of the problem actually is. In doing that you will look for structural similarities between the problem posed and other problems that arise in different fields that others may have addressed successfully. Those similarities may point you to a pathway for resolving the problem you have been asked to solve. But it is not enough to look for structural similarities. Sometimes relying on similarities may even be misleading. Once youâve settled tentatively on what you take to be the heart of the matter, you will naturally look for materials, whether evidence or arguments, that you believe is relevant to its potential solution. But the evidence you investigate of course depends on your formulation of the problem, and your formulation of the problem likely depends on the tools you have available â including potential sources of evidence and argumentation. You cannot ignore this interactivity, but you canât allow yourself to be hamstrung entirely by it. But there is more. The problem itself may be too big to be manageable all at once, so you will have to explore whether it can be broken into manageable parts and if the information you have bears on all or only some of those parts. And later you will face the problem of whether the solutions to the particular sub problems can be put together coherently to solve the entire problem taken as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you are doing is what we call engaging in computational thinking. There are several elements of computational thinking illustrated above. These include: Decomposition (breaking the larger problem down into smaller ones); Pattern recognition (identifying structural similarities); Abstraction (ignoring irrelevant particulars of the problem); and Creating Algorithms (problem-solving formulas). But even more basic to what you are doing is the process of drawing inferences from the material you have. After all, how else are you going to create a problem-solving formula, if you draw incorrect inferences about what information has.\n",
      "## Logic and Computational Thinking\n",
      "\n",
      "What you must do is apply the rules of logic to the information to draw inferences that are warranted. We distinguish between informal and formal systems of logic, both of which are designed to indicate fallacies as well as warranted inferences. If I argue for a conclusion by appealing to my physical ability to coerce you, I prove nothing about the truth of what I claim. If anything, by doing so I display my lack of confidence in my argument. Or if the best I can do is berate you for your skepticism, I have done little more than offer an ad hominem instead of an argument. Our focus will be on formal systems of logic, since they are at the heart of both scientific argumentation and computer developed algorithms.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are in fact many different kinds of logic and all figure to varying degrees in scientific inquiry. There are inductive types of logic, which purport to formalize the relationship between premises that if true offer evidence on behalf of a conclusion and the conclusion and are represented as claims about the extent to which the conclusion is confirmed by the premises. There are deductive types of logic, which introduce a different relationship between premise and conclusion. These variations of logic consist in rules that if followed entail that if the premises are true then the conclusion too must be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also modal types of logic which are applied specifically to the concepts of necessity and possibility, and thus to the relationship among sentences that include either or both those terms. And there is also what are called deontic logic, a modification of logic that purport to show that there are rules of inference that allow us to infer what we ought to do from facts about the circumstances in which we find ourselves. In the natural and social sciences most of the emphasis has been placed on inductive logic, whereas in math it is placed on deductive logic, and in modern physics there is an increasing interest in the concepts of possibility and necessity and thus in modal logic. The humanities, especially normative discussions in philosophy and literature are the province of deontic logic.\n",
      "\n",

The aim of the module is to provide an overview of alternative logics and to develop a sensitivity that there are many different logics that can provide effective tools for solving problems in specific application domains.\n",
      "\n",
      "The module first reviews the principles of a traditional logic and then introduces many-valued logics that distinguish more than two truth values, for example true, false, and unknown. Fuzzy logic extends traditional logic by replacing truth values with real numbers in the range 0 to 1 that are expressing how strong the belief into a proposition is. Modal logics introduce modal operators expressing whether a proposition is necessary or possible. Temporal logics deal with propositions that are qualified by time. One can view temporal logics as a form of modal logics where propositions are...\n",
      "## Qualified by Time Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "Interval temporal logic provides a way to reason about time intervals in which propositions are true. The module will also investigate the application of logic frameworks to specific classes of problems. For example, a special subset of predicate logic, based on so-called Horn clauses, forms the basis of logic programming languages such as Prolog. Description logics, which are usually decidable logics, are used to model relationships and they have applications in the semantic web, which enables search engines to reason about resources present on the Internet.\n",

      "In many ways, life is a journey. And also, as in other journeys, our success or failure depends not only on our personal traits and character, our physical and mental health, but also on the accuracy of our map. We need to know what the world we are navigating is actually like, the how, why and the what of what makes it work the way it does. The natural sciences provide the most important tool we have developed to learn how the world works and why it works the way it does. The social sciences provide the most advanced tools we have to learn how we and other human beings, similar in most ways, different in many others, act and react and what makes them do what they do. In order for our maps to be useful, they must be accurate and correctly reflect the way the natural and social worlds work and why they work as they do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural sciences and social sciences are blessed with enormous amounts of data. In this way, history and the present are gifts to us. To understand how and why the world works the way it does requires that we are able to offer an explanation of it. The data supports a number of possible explanations of it. How are we to choose among potential explanations? Explanations, if sound, will enable us to make reliable predictions about what the future will be like, and also to identify many possibilities that may unfold in the future. But there are differences not just in the degree of confidence we have in our predictions, but in whether some of them are necessary future states or whether all of them are merely possibilities? Thus, there are three related activities at the core of scientific inquiry: understanding where we\n",
      "## Text\n",
      "\n",
      "are now and how we got here (historical); knowing what to expect going forward (prediction); and exploring how we can change the paths we are on (creativity).\n",
      "\n",
      "At the heart of these activities are certain fundamental concepts, all of which are related to the scientific quest to uncover immutable and unchanging laws of nature. Laws of nature are thought to reflect a causal nexus between a previous event and a future one. There are also true statements that reflect universal or nearly universal connections between events past and present that are not laws of nature because the relationship they express is that of a correlation between events. A working thermostat accurately allows us to determine or even to predict the temperature in the room in which it is located, but it does not explain why the room has the temperature it has. What then is the core difference between causal relationships and correlations? At the same time, we all recognize that given where we are now there are many possible futures for each of us, and even had our lives gone just the slightest bit differently than they have, our present state could well have been very different than it is. The relationship between possible pathways between events that have not materialized but could have is expressed through the idea of counterfactual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating accurate roadmaps, forming expectations we can rely on, making the world a more verdant and attractive place requires us to understand the concepts of causation, correlation, counterfactual explanation, prediction, necessity, possibility, law of nature and universal generalization. This course is designed precisely to provide the conceptual tools and intellectual skills to implement those concepts in our future readings and research and ultimately in our experimental investigations, and to employ those tools in various disciplines.\n",

      "Causality or causation is a surprisingly difficult concept to understand. David Hume famously noted that causality is a concept that our science and philosophy cannot do without, but it is equally a concept that our science and philosophy cannot describe. Since Hume, the problem of cause has not gone away, and sometimes seems to get even worse (e.g., quantum mechanics confusing previous notions of causality). Yet, ways of doing science that lessen our need to explicitly use causality have become very effective (e.g., huge developments in statistics). Nevertheless, it still seems that the concept of causality is at the core of explaining how the world works, across fields as diverse as physics, medicine, logistics, the law, sociology, and history â and ordinary daily life â through all of which, explanations and predictions in terms of cause and effect remain intuitively central.\n",
      "\n",
      "Causality remains a thorny problem but, in recent decades, significant progress has occurred, particularly in work by or inspired by Judea Pearl. This work incorporates many 20th century developments, including statistical methods â but with a reemphasis on finding the why, or the cause, behind statistical correlations â, progress in understanding the logic, semantics and metaphysics of conditionals and counterfactuals, developments based on insights from the likes of philosopher Hans Reichenbach or biological statistician Sewall Wright into causal precedence and path analysis, and much more. The result is a new toolkit to identify causes and build causal explanations. Yet even as we get better at identifying causes, this raises new (or old) questions about causality, including metaphysical questions about the nature of causes (and effects, events, objects, etc), but also questions about what we really use causality for (understanding the world as it is or just to glean predictive control of specific outcomes), about how causality is used differently in different fields.\n",
      "## Course Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "This course will introduce students to the mathematical formalism derived from Pearlâs work, based on directed acyclic graphs and probability theory. Building upon previous work by Reichenbach and Wright, Pearl defines a \"a calculus of interventions\" of \"do-calculus\" for talking about interventions and their relation to causation and counterfactuals. This model has been applied in various areas ranging from econometrics to statistics, where acquiring knowledge about causality is of great importance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the course will not forget some of the metaphysical and epistemological issues around cause, so that students can better critically evaluate putative causal explanations in their full context. Abstractly, such issues involve some of the same philosophical questions Hume already asked, but more practically, it is important to see how metaphysical and epistemological debates surrounding the notion of cause affect scientific practice, and equally if not more importantly, how scientific practice pushes the limits of theory. This course will look at various ways in which empirical data can be transformed into explanations and theories, including the variance approach to causality (characteristic of the positivistic quantitative paradigm), and the process theory of causality (associated with qualitative methodology). Examples and case studies will be relevant for students of the social sciences but also students of the natural/physical world as well.\n",

      "There are no universal 'right skills'. But the notion of linear models and the avenue to matrices and their properties can be useful in diverse disciplines to implement a quantitative, computational approach. Some of the most popular data and systems analysis strategies are built upon this framework. Examples include principal component analysis (PCA), the optimization techniques used in Operations Research (OR), the assessment of stable and unstable states in nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as aspects of machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here we introduce the toolbox of linear models and matrix-based methods embedded in a wide range of transdisciplinary applications (part 1). We describe its foundation in linear algebra (part 2) and the range of tools and methods derived from this conceptual framework (part 3). At the end of the course, we outline applications to graph theory and machine learning (part 4). Matrices can be useful representations of networks and of system of linear equations. They are also the core object of linear stability analysis, an approach used in nonlinear dynamics. Throughout the course, examples from neuroscience, social sciences, medicine, biology, physics, chemistry, and other fields are used to illustrate these methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong emphasis of the course is on the sensible usage of linear approaches in a nonlinear world. We will critically reflect the advantages as well as the disadvantages and limitations of this method. Guiding questions are: How appropriate is a linear approximation of a nonlinear system? What do you really learn from PCA? How reliable are the optimal states obtained via linear programming (LP) techniques?\n",
      "\n",
      "This debate is embedded in a broader context: How does the choice of a mathematical technique confine your view on the system at hand? How, on the other hand, does it increase your capabilities of analyzing the system (due to software).\n",

      "In the end, students will have a clearer understanding of linear models and matrix approaches in their own discipline, but they will also see the full transdisciplinarity of this topic. They will make better decisions in their choice of data analysis methods and become mindful of the challenges when going from a linear to a nonlinear thinking.\n",

      "Complex problems are, by definition, non-linear and/or emergent. Some fifty years ago, scholars such as Herbert Simon began to argue that societies around the world had developed an impressive array of tools with which to solve simple and even complicated problems, but still needed to develop methods with which to address the rapidly increasing number of complex issues. Since then, a variety of such methods has emerged. These include:\n",

      "- âmultisector systems analysisâ applied in civil and environmental engineering\n",

      "- âreal-time technology assessmentâ advocated in science and technology studies\n",
      "- âdeliberative decision-makingâ emanating from political science.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this course, students first learn to distinguish between simple, complicated, and complex problems. They also become familiar with the ways in which a particular issue can sometimes shift from one category into another. In addition, the participants learn to apply several tools for resolving complex problems. Finally, the students are introduced to the various ways in which natural and social scientists can help stakeholders resolve complex problems. Throughout the course, examples and applications will be used. When possible, guest lectures will be offered by experts on a particular tool for tackling complex issues. For the written, take-home exam, students will have to select a specific complex problem, analyze it, and come up with a recommendation â in addition to answering several questions about the material learned.\n",

      "One must be careful not to confuse argumentation with being argumentative. The latter is an unattractive personal attribute, whereas the former is a requirement of publicly holding a belief, asserting the truth of a proposition, the plausibility of a hypothesis, or a judgment of the value of a person or an asset. It is an essential component of public discourse. Public discourse is governed by norms and one of those norms is that those who assert the truth of a proposition or the validity of an argument or the responsibility of another for wrongdoing open themselves up to good faith requests to defend their claims. In its most general meaning, argumentation is the requirement that one offer evidence in support of the claims they make, as well as in defense of the judgments and assessments they reach. There are different modalities of argumentation associated with different contexts and disciplines. Legal arguments have a structure of their own as do assessments of medical conditions and moral character. In each case, there are differences in the kind of evidence that is thought relevant and, more importantly, in the standards of assessment for whether a case has been successfully made. Different modalities of argumentation require can call for different modes of reasoning. We not only offer reasons in defense of or in support of beliefs we have, judgments we make and hypotheses we offer, but we reason from evidence we collect to conclusions that are warranted by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning can be informal and sometimes even appear unstructured. When we recognize some reasoning as unstructured yet appropriate what we usually have in mind is that it is not linear. Most reasoning we are familiar with is linear in character. From A we infer B, and from A and B we infer C, which all together support our commitment to D. The same form of reasoning applies whether the evidence for A, B or C is direct or circumstantial. What changes in these cases is perhaps the weight we give to the evidence and thus the confidence we have in drawing inferences from it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Especially in cases where reasoning can be supported by quantitative data, wherever quantitative data can be obtained either directly or by linear or nonlinear models, the visualization of the corresponding data can become key in both, reasoning and argumentation. A graphical representation can reduce the complexity of argumentation and is considered a must in effective scientific communication. Consequently, the course will also focus on smart and compelling ways for data visualization - in ways that go beyond what is typically taught in statistics or mathematics lectures. These tools are constantly developing, as a reflection of new software and changes in state of the presentation art. Which graph or bar chart to use best for which data, the use of colors to underline messages and arguments, but also the pitfalls when presenting data in a poor or even misleading manner. This will also help in readily identifying intentional misrepresentation of data by others, the simplest to recognize being truncating the ordinate of a graph in order to exaggerate trends. This frequently leads to false arguments, which can then be readily countered.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other modalities of reasoning that are not linear however. Instead they are coherentist. We argue for the plausibility of a claim sometimes by showing that it fits in with a set of other claims for which we have independent support. The fit is itself the reason that is supposed to provide confidence or grounds for believing the contested claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other times, the nature of reasoning involves establishing not just the fit but the mutual support individual items in the evidentiary set provide for one another. This is the familiar idea of a web of interconnected, mutually supportive beliefs. In some cases, the support is in all instances strong; in others it is uniformly weak, but the set is very large; in other cases, the support provided each bit of evidence for the other is mixed: sometimes strong, sometimes weak, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three fundamental ideas that we want to extract from this segment of the course. These are (1) that argumentation is itself a requirement of being a researcher who claims to have made findings of one sort or another; (2) that there are different forms of appropriate argumentation for different domains and circumstances; and (3) that there are different forms of reasoning on behalf of various claims or from various bits of evidence to conclusions: whether those conclusions are value judgments, political beliefs, or scientific conclusions. Our goal is to familiarize you with all three of these deep ideas and to help you gain facility with each.\n",

      "Humans are a social species and interaction is crucial throughout the entire life span. While much of human communication involves language, there is a complex multichannel system of nonverbal communication that enriches linguistic content, provides context, and is also involved in structuring dynamic interaction. Interactants achieve goals by encoding information that is interpreted in the light of current context in transactions with others. This complexity implies also that there are frequent misunderstandings as a senderâs intention is not fulfilled.\n",

      "Each of us is judged by the actions we undertake and held to account for the consequences of them. Sometimes we may be lucky and our bad acts don't have harmful effects on others. Other times we may be unlucky and reasonable decisions can lead to unexpected or unforeseen adverse consequences for others. We are therefore held accountable both for choices and for outcomes. In either case, accountability expresses the judgment that we bear responsibility for what we do and what happens as a result. But our responsibility and our accountability in these cases is closely connected to the idea that we have agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agency presumes that we are the source of the choices we make and the actions that result from those choices. For some, this may entail the idea that we have free will. But there is a scientific world view that holds that all actions are determined by the causes that explain them, which is the idea that if we knew the causes of your decisions in advance, we would know the decision you would make even before you made it. If that is so, how can your choice be free? And if it is not free, how can you be responsible for it? And if you cannot be responsible, how can we justifiably hold you to account for it? These questions express the centuries-old questions about the relationship between free will and a determinist world view: for some, the conflict between a scientific world view and a moral world view.\n",
      "## Text\n",
      "\n",
      "But we do not always act as individuals. In society we organize ourselves into groups: e.g. tightly organized social groups, loosely organized market economies, political societies, companies, and more. These groups have structure. Some individuals are given the responsibility of leading the group and of exercising authority. But one can exercise authority over others in a group merely by giving orders and threatening punishment for non-compliance. Exercising authority is not the same thing as being a leader? For one can lead by example or by encouraging others to exercise personal judgment and authority. What then is the essence of leadership?\n",
      "\n",
      "The module has several educational goals. The first is for students to understand the difference between actions that we undertake for which we can reasonably held accountable and things that we do but which we are not responsible for. For example, a twitch is an example of the latter, but so too may be a car accident we cause as a result of a heart attack we had no way of anticipating or controlling. This suggests the importance of control to responsibility. At the heart of personal agency is the idea of control. The second goal is for students to understand what having control means. Some think that the scientific view is that the world is deterministic, and if it is then we cannot have any personal control over what happens, including what we do. Others think that the quantum scientific view entails a degree of indeterminacy and that free will and control are possible, but only in the sense of being unpredictable or random. But then random outcomes are not ones we control either. So, we will devote most attention to trying to understand the relationships between control, causation and predictability.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we do not only exercise agency in isolation. Sometimes we act as part of groups and organizations. The law often recognizes ways in which groups and organizations can have rights, but is there a way in which we can understand how groups have responsibility for outcomes that they should be accountable for. We need to figure out then whether there is a notion of group agency that does not simply boil down to the sum of individual actions. We will explore the ways in which individual actions lead to collective agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we will explore the ways in which occupying a leadership role can make one accountable for the actions of others over which one has authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Intended Learning Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Students acquire transferable and key skills in this module. By the end of this module, the students will be able to:\n",
      "1. understand and reflect how the social and moral world views that rely on agency and responsibility are compatible, if they are, with current scientific world views.\n",
      "2. understand how science is an economic sector, populated by large powerful organizations that set norms and fund research agendas.\n",
      "3. identify the difference between being a leader of others or of a group â whether a research group or a lab or a company â and being in charge of the group.\n",
      "4. learn to be a leader of others and groups. Understand that when one graduates one will enter not just a field of work but a heavily structured set of institutions and that oneâs agency and responsibility for what happens, what work gets done, its quality and value, will be affected accordingly.\n",

The course aims to give students an understanding of how science produces knowledge, and some of the various contexts and issues which mean this process is never entirely transparent, neutral, or unproblematic.

      "Of the five senses, the sense of sight has for a long time occupied the central position in human cultures. As John Berger has suggested this could be because we can see and recognize the world around us before we learn how to speak. Images have been with us since the earliest days of human history. In fact, the earliest records of human history are images found on cave walls across the world. We use images to capture abstract ideas, to catalogue and organize the world, to represent the world, to capture specific moments, to trace time and change, to tell stories, to express feelings, to better understand, to provide evidence and more. At the same time, images exert their power on us, seducing us into believing in their âinnocenceâ, that is into forgetting that as representations they are also interpretations, i.e., a particular version of the world.\n",

      "The purpose of this course is to explore multiple ways in which images and the visual in general mediate and structure human experiences and practices from more specialized discourses, e.g., scientific discourses, to more informal and personal day-to-day practices, such as self-fashioning in cyberspace. We will look at how social and historical contexts affect how we see, as well as what is visible and what is not. We will explore the centrality of the visual to the intellectual activity, from early genres of scientific drawing to visualizations of big data. We will examine whether one can speak of visual culture of protest, look at the relationship between looking and subjectivity and, most importantly, ponder the relationship between the visual and the real.\n",
